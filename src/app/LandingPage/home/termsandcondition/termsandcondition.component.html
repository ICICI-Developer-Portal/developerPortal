        Applicability of terms of this Agreement

        Function of the Portal
        <p>Developer Portal will provide User with certain Developer Program Tools for use in ICICI Bank’s Sandbox. “Sandbox” means ICICI Bank’s test environment, which contains dummy data and functionality for User to create and test apps (including User’s applications) that may eventually allow ICICI Bank’s customers to exercise various functionalities with their ICICI Bank accounts or other ICICI Bank’s products and services.</p>
        <p>ICICI Bank may send invitation email carrying information pertaining to Developer Account, including Login Credentials to the registered email address of the User from ___________only upon receiving all the relevant information from the User in the format acceptable to ICICI Bank. </p>
        <p>The Registered Developer shall be liable for all acts and omissions on the Developer Portal associated with such Developer Account.</p>
        <p>Through these accounts, User will be able to register User’s Apps with the Portal. On a case-by-case basis, ICICI Bank may grant User access to certain application programming interfaces and related software (“APIs”) that ICICI Bank makes available through the Portal, as well as relevant documentation. User will receive unique Credentials for identifying each of User’s Apps, and User will need these Credentials for all calls User’s Apps make to an API. Please note, that User will only upload dummy data on the Sandbox.</p>
        <p>ICICI Bank shall have absolute right to provide access to its own live production environment to the Users which may require execution of separate agreement with the User.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>POTENTIAL STEPS AFTER SANDBOX TESTING</p>
        <p>ICICI Bank may select certain Apps to move past Sandbox testing. In order to move the Apps to other environments maintained by ICIC Bank, the User shall get its Apps certified by ICICI Bank. To certify User’s Apps, ICICI Bank shall be satisfied among other criteria that the Apps meet certain standards, specifications, and policies. ICICI Bank reserves the right to revoke such certificates at any time without assigning any reason.</p>
        <p>The following are the bare minimum requirement of the Apps to be certified:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>
              <p>Incorporate enrolment and authentication technologies, processes and procedures appropriate to mitigate the risk of unauthorized enrolment or access to sensitive customer information or funds transfer functionality;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Validate device characteristics (e.g., level of security controls, operating system type, operating system version, whether the mobile device is rooted or jail broken, and patch status);</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Contain a process to deactivate older versions that no longer meet minimum security requirements or prompt the end user to upgrade to an acceptable version;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Ensure that critical information (e.g., passwords and account or card numbers) does not reside directly on a device, unless essential to the Apps’ functionality. If critical information does reside on the device, the Apps should encrypt and securely store such information (e.g., within an encrypted data section or within encrypted storage in the file system);</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Employ secure development and distribution techniques for Apps;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Collect any end user information only as necessary, and appropriately secure such information and any derived analytics reporting available within or external to the Apps;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Mitigate the risk of unpatched devices or those that are no longer supported by the manufacturer;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Securely wipe any sensitive end user information upon exiting the Apps; and</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Secure back-end servers containing the App and customer data.</p>
           </li>
        </ul>
        <p>ICICI Bank reserves the right to add any other requirement for the certification of the Apps. Please note that User’s Apps development processes may be subject to audit and must employ secure techniques and rigorous testing. The same terms shall be applicable on open source software as well.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>LICENSE GRANT TO USER</p>
        <p>ICICI Bank grants to User a limited, nonexclusive, as-is, revocable, non-transferable, non-sub licensable license to access and use the Developer Portal and Developer Program Tools solely for purposes of developing, testing, and using Apps in the Sandbox.
